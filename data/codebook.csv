This is a survey conducted for academic research purposes by researchers from Harvard University and the OECD. It will take approximately 25 minutes to complete. The survey data is used for research purposes only, and the research is non-partisan. You will be compensated for this survey if you complete the survey and your responses pass our survey quality checks. These checks use statistical control methods to detect incoherent and rushed responses. It is very important for the validity of our research that you answer honestly and read the questions carefully before answering.

 
The survey collects personal data, including socio-demographic characteristics and political views. All of the answers you provide will remain anonymous and be treated with absolute confidentiality. The personal data we collect will be transferred and stored on secure servers. Only researchers working on the project will have access to the anonymized data. Your participation in this survey is completely voluntary. You are entitled to choose not to take part. If at first you agree to take part, you can later change your mind. Your decision will not be held against you in any way. Your refusal to participate will not result in any consequences or any loss of benefits that you are otherwise entitled to receive. You can ask any questions before you decide whether to participate.  

 

If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has offended you, you can contact the research team at social.economics.research2020@gmail.com or call the Harvard University Area Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at (617) 496-2847. The OECD is committed to protecting the personal data it processes, in accordance with its Personal Data Protection Rules (https://www.oecd.org/general/data-protection.htm).

Such a policy would progressively raise the price of fossil fuels (for example, the price of gasoline would increase by 15 cents per litre in the first years). Higher prices would encourage people and companies to use less fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Revenues from the tax would be used to finance a basic income of $41/month to each human adult, thereby lifting the 700 million people who earn less than $2.7/day out of extreme poverty. Most Australians would lose out financially as they would face $182 per month in price increases, which is higher than the $41 they would receive.

donation_agg,donation_agg,"donation: By taking this survey, you are automatically entered into a lottery to win $100. In a few days you will know whether you have been selected in the lottery. The payment will be made to you in the same way as your compensation for this survey, so no further action is required on your part. 

  
You can also donate a part of this additional compensation (should you be selected in the lottery) to a reforestation project through the charity The Gold Standard. This charity has already proven effective to reduce 151 million tons of CO2 to fight climate change and has been carefully selected by our team. The Gold Standard is highly transparent and ensures that its projects feature the highest levels of environmental integrity and contribute to sustainable development.
