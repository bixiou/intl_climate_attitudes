Currently, where I live, to get to a store, you need to take a car. Some areas are not at all accessible for pedestrian or bike traffic. Accidents involving bikes and pedestrians is too frequent, and this is in recently built infrastructure. \n  \n Also, to impose a 14 cent increase on fossil fuel for the individual is not factoring in those who are disabled (personal vehicle dependent), or those who live outside major urban areas. Even if you do have access to transit, if you have a large grocery load, there's no space for you (even more now due to COVID restrictions). \n  \n If there was some sort of trade-in system for carbon vehicles (profit margins not in consideration), then I could see the switch to electric going more smoothly, and an increase of fossil fuel prices. If no, then corporate greed will inevitably create a larger wealth gap, and we end up taxing the people who need help. 750 dollars annually is not enough. The system is skewed towards the wealthy. \n  \n Another thing that was missed - same day shipping/delivery. If we did away with this expectation of getting what we want right away, truck traffic would be less. \n  \n I would also wonder how much carbon emissions would be lessened if we stopped allowing major companies like Apple to release new phones every year, and improving their repairs/refurbish program.";"None at this time";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"no comments";"NA";"Very good survey, it makes you think, about different things";"NA";"No comments";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"No";"The answers are a lot more complex than a multiple choice allows - comment boxes throughout would allow for more nuanced input.
