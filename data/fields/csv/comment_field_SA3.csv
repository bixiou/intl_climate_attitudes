If I may be honest without being disrespectful, I didn't have much space to provide an opinion where I had one. many of the sections did not have a box like this one. However I would like to say that many south africans are simply too poor to adapt to climate change initiatives and imposing tax on the already struggling working class might be a bad idea because we know our government leaders to be untrustworthy and greedy simply. I hope I will not be in trouble for my remarks. The best way in my thoughts is to make green energy popular among the lower income community as a solution to expensive electricity. we need local manufacturers to fabricate solar panels and make them affordable. once two or 3 houses in the townships and locations have them, they will become fashionable and popular. People simply do not know the benefits of alternative and green energy and at the moment it is simply too expensive. But if we can produce it locally, we can solve many of the polution problems and most of the working class population commutes with combustion engines. I have a vision of children building and riding electric scooters to school in the rural areas, solving the transport problem, learning to use solar and stored energy to solve the problem of the government not coming to connect them to grid.
