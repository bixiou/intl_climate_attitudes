I suggest also to look into whether some companies are greenwashing and whether they do illegal waste in rivers and so because unfortunately that happens. If any of this is implemented people need to understand why and what the consequences in the future will be if they don't change now. That will make them more open to contribution. So an educational movie or segment should be played live Nationally in order to educate first and then after that in the next day, run another segment to give suggestions on what we as individuals can do, what companies can do to help contribute on healing the world, next show some suggestions that we could implement (for example the Paris agreement, taxing on millionaires and  better environmentally friendly car suggestions) and look at the response on social media (Mainly twitter and facebook) be sure to post all the segments on youtube and see the responses in the comments. This will guide you on what to do next. Make the segments clear to understand, visually and audibly pleasing, honest, and of good quality.

Now don't get me wrong there is a lot leaning more towards the idea of climate change. What isn't taken into consideration is that it cannot only be our fault and we may not be the main cause of these drastic changes in the climate around us. The earth is a large and we don't inhabit every single part of it a lot of it remains unexplored and untouched. Which leads to my next point large companies and corporations that heavily promoted the consumption of CO2 products and manufacturing processess should also be held liable for not doing their due diligence and following up on the effects of their products and practices.
