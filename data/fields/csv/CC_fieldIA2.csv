Therefore different modeling studies, adaptation strategies and technology systems would be required in differing geographical and social contexts. Further, there are many uncertainties in disaggregating the effects of global warming on different agro climatic regions due to still inadequate scientific understanding of the processes involved in the climate change. This would require developing a strong capability in basic and applied research in climate science by strengthening observational and modeling tools and systems. India is too large a country to adopt strategies based on global averages of climate change. The current levels of uncertainties associated with likely consequences of climate change in various regions of the country are significant and do not enable the development of strategic action plans for different regions within the country. There are a number of constraints that limit at present the ability of the national knowledge system to deliver the required and expected outcomes for effective response. Addressing these constraints through strategic actions that include the development of appropriate institutional and human resource capacity for this purpose will form the main goal of the National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change.
