Little things like not using plastic to package fruit & vegetables and making loose versions as cheap, because not many families, us included, can always afford to buy loose. We choose plastic packaged products because they are generally cheaper.  We make attempts to walk as much as we can rather than use the car because we have an old diesel car but cant afford anything newer! We recycle as much as possible and have two recycle bins which are overflowing when they are emptied every 2 weeks because of the way our food is packaged, and the local council wont let us have a third.

While individuals alone may not be able to make drastic emissions cuts that limit climate change to acceptable levels, personal action is essential to raise the importance of issues to policymakers and businesses.\n \n Using our voice as a consumer, a customer, a member of the electorate and an active citizen, will lead to changes on a much grander scale.";"Introducing new legislation that all businesses need to abide by to be more environmentally friendly?
