Platforms on subway and LRT systems are not deep enough.  I would fear that I could be pushed onto a track by crowds.  I feel threatened by the type of people who are on public transit.  I feel that I would be robbed or followed home when I get off public transit.  Sidewalks (if you have them) are not cleared for it to be safe for me to walk in the winter.  I would NEVER use public transit after dark.  \n When I was raising my own children at home I would not have been able to carry all of my groceries home by myself on public transit. \n Their timing is not convenient.  On one occasion which comes to mind it took me 75 minutes on public transit to reach a location which if I had driven would have taken 15 minutes. \n We have already lost our rail system.   \n Public transit does nothing for people in more rural areas.  I have a son and his family who live in Richmond Ontario.  There is NO public transit from west end Ottawa to Richmond except for morning and end of work day service on weekdays.  I would never be able to visit them.  \n Going anywhere takes much too long on public transit,  At certain times and days of the week buses only stop once every 30 minutes.  I need to remind these policy makers that we have WINTER  weather most of the year.  It isn’t any fun waiting for public transit.   \n These policy makers and politicians get CHAUFFEURED around.  Make them use public transit for a year and see how that works for them.  And don’t have them living in densely populated areas where transit is easily accessible! \n Bicycle paths are often suggested.  1. Not everyone knows how to ride a bike. 2. Again, WINTER!! 3. Not everyone has access to shower facilities when they get to work. 4. I could never have biked home from the grocery store with 4 - 4 litre bags of milk and all of the other groceries I purchased.  5. Personal safety on these bike paths.  6. Our roads aren’t built for cyclists.  7. Nice idea for exercise and leisurely time on the weekend. 8. WINTER- did You forget about WINTER! Not a practical solution for a significant part of the year. \n What about those countries in the world where people are still burning wood or coal EVERY SINGLE DAY to make their meals? \n What are they going to do about that? \n What are we doing about using water power for electricity? \n I am all in favour of solving climate change. It is REAL.   \n BUT I feel that a few people are going to be lining their pockets and nothing real is going to be done in the end. \n As a widow, a senior and on a fixed pension I am already having to pay so much, I have to live uncomfortably without my heat (or A/C) to save money so that I can barely exist.  I worry about how some of these plans will impact me. \n I’ve already spoken about electric vehicles- cost to charge, lack of charging stations, not being able to charge at home, the cost of the electricity to charge a vehicle, the inconvenience of not being able to charge my vehicle at home in a regular outlet, the length of time to charge, the short distance you get out of a charged battery, the cost of the vehicle itself, etc., etc., etc. \n Meanwhile the very rich can afford to carry on doing as they please because they can afford it.   \n I wish I had the solution.";"None";"Good topic";"NA";"No comment";"NA";"NA";"none to share";"NA";"Perhaps too strong on climate";"climate change is another way for government taxation.

Also, maybe some program in place to help them purchase an electric vehicle.  \n  \n People should have to apply for the money and prove what vehicle or transportation they take, which wouldn't be difficult.  \n  \n Insurance policies would state vehicle they drive. \n DMV would state whether they even have license to drive. \n  \n We should not be giving people who drive gas powered vehicles money back, otherwise what's the point in taxing them in the first place?
