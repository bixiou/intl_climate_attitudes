People will be eager to use RELIABLE public transport. At present, using a taxi is similar to taking a change on your life, as it is not roadworthy, let alone electronic. Something like an electronic bus would be perfect. \n People should be educated more on saving. This is something our grandparents taught us. \n Having an electronic car might not be the answer for me as I drive 120km every day to work and back. Will the power last that long?
