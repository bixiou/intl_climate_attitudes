When it comes to reducing waste, the government should put less responsibility on the consumer and more on the producer/manufacturer. Although it's important that each and every individual do their part to reduce waste, there is only so much that can be done on the part of the consumer. Stronger regulations with respect to product packaging need to be put into place and, even more importantly - enforced. Many items are sold in plastic packaging that is non-recyclable. In addition to this, individually wrapped items (sold, of course, in non-recyclable materials) are becoming more prevalent. Regulations that limit the use of non-recyclable materials in production need to be created and enforced. Incentives could also be made available to producers/manufacturers that take steps towards ensuring their products are designed and packaged with waste reduction in mind. For example, there's a company that sells laundry detergent in cardboard-type packaging that is much safer for the environment - they could be offered an incentive or tax break.";"PNR";"Climate change is very scary.
