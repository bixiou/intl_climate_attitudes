This is especially true in the Arctic region. If you are unaware of what climate change is, it is a global or regional change in weather patterns that lasts for a long period of time. Climate change is greatly caused by the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide which is produced by the use of fossil fuels, such as exhaust from cars and trucks, burning trash, and factory emissions. These are also contributing to global warming which is, a gradual increase in the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. Some effects of global warming in the Arctic are rising temperatures in the air and in the water surrounding the Arctic. Another is the loss of sea ice and melting of ice sheets which is caused by the increased temperatures. This also greatly impacts the Arctic plants and animals, they are rapidly dying, decreasing in numbers, possibly leading to their extinction. The melting ice sheets are destroying the wildlife population and increasing the sea level.";"I honestly have no idea";"I think they should care more about the environment, since it has a huge impact and role on the earth's ecosystem.";"I think the government should regulate the big business with the waste they produce.

I feel like they should be burning it to help not pollute the waters and the earth surrounding it. I also think that the government should create jobs, in every city, where people walk around picking up garbage, to also help stop climate change/global warmer. And to get people to actually want to apply to the job, make it a government job (in a sense, kind of like how working at LCBO is a government job). Or if you dont want to make it a government job, make it a unionized job and pay them alittle bit more than minimum wage like $15.00 and then have every year, it go up by a dollar. You can even give benefits after the first year or something along those lines, to entice people to want to do the work, or to want to get the job. This could also help with 1000 of youth out there that are in need of a job and cant find one and also help our homelessness rate go down because they would be working. Hell, you can even recruit some homeless people to do the work and pay them too, give them a sense of purpose.

While it is important to fight climate change, this should not be at the cost of some Canadians more than others. I know people that farm and work in Saskatchewan, and because it is so much colder in the winter, the carbon tax they pay is a crazy amount. To make them suffer more than the rest of Canada is unfair. Businesses and farms in colder areas have suffered financially from some of the government moves to fight climate change, and the worst part is that they couldn't care less. So while I think it is important to fight climate change, we need to understand that the transition from unsustainable resources is a transition we cannot rush, and this cannot be done in a way that harms certain Canadians more than others.
