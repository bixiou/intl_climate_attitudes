Unless all countries really do try to consider this then little will be achieved.  UK is going too far too fast and given our relatively low level of impact on the earth's climate.  The costs and inconveniences that are proposed upon UK citizens is far too much.  UK is trying to do far too much in it's pursuit of \'green\' policies without fully considering all the implications for the general public be it financial and/or practicality.";"In the UK, consider the main causes: which I think are transport, construction, power and food. Then consider what can be done to alleviate those causes. For transport, replace use of cars and airplanes with public transport and walking or bicycling. Encourage use of electrical vehicles. For construction, I don't know what can be done (tho' better insulation will reduce the need for heating, and better design and insulation the need for cooling (air conditioning). For power, stop subsidising use of fossil fuels and encourage the use of renewables. For food, encourage a reduction of meat eating, and reduce food miles. In all cases care is necessary. Obvious answers can be wrong: for example I understand it may be better to import fruit and veg. from say Spain, despite the effect of transport, than to grow them in the UK using fossil fuels in the growing process.";"The climate is changing towards worse and danger for our planet.\n UK government should work with the other countries to rectify things to improve climate change for the betterment and to secure the future of mankind and the planet.";"Stop lying";"I think there should be more laws regarding climate change, compelling companies to act in certain ways to preserve the environment and reduce large organisations’ carbon footprint.";"Get of there backsides, pull there fingers out and do something";"everyone playing their part from individual to big business from turning off a light bulb when not in use to use sustainable materials and recyclable materials when building products and services";"I think people should take it more seriously";"I worry about worsening weather conditions, particularly flooding and storms.

The UK has become too much of a car country and public transport has suffered as a result. The government should invest in making public transport as efficient, safe and price competitive as car usage. Another way to address co2 emissions is to reduce the need for mass farming. People should be encouraged to eat less meat and plant based foods should be priced as competitively as meat.";"Do things in a sensible controlled way not knee jerk reactions.

There needs to be a reliable source of constant power (probably nuclear) that can cope with the future needs of electricity over gas.
