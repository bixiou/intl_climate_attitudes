Agenda 2030 nvolves changing the world in order to justify the things that the Elite and large government and private enterprises, world banking houses, and the 3 largest Foundation's operated under philanthropy by the Clinton's,  Gates and Soros.They believe , or say they do, that these proposed changes will prevent further anthropogenic climate change.  Only it won't but it WILL bring in global Socialism under a world government.  Our current economies must crash and consumerism, free choice and freedom of any kind crashes with it only to be replaced by an energy based system based on carbon credits. You have a card, like the vaccine passports currently being rolled out around the world,  and you are allocated, a \'living wage\' under a \'Green New Deal\' -Socialism for 2030 where you must use only the carbon credits you've been allocated or you will have to trade for more to offset your overusage or have nothing until you do.. You will live in a box near to public transport because you won't own a car,. You will live without air conditioning, own nothing even your shoes, have no pets because they carry coronaviruses and are \'dirty\', just like the Jews were in Hitler's time, or at least he told the Germans they were, and we will eat no meat or dairy of any kind because of the methane they fart out. We will all have a chip to \'buy and sell\' too as well as 24/7 mobitoring of everything we do and where we go, etc. There will be no freedom. We will have a neural transplant because that's transhumanism or Human 2.0 and most young people are infertile. So no unplanned pregnancies. Most people are dead from the \'vaccines\' that have been pushed on people and there are no small businesses, home ownership or middle class. By 2050 there will be 500 million of us only Now I'm personally  happy that this world will be destroyed because by God we deserve it for our selfishness, malice and cruelty.

I also supply plants free to others. If every person does a small amount this will help our country - it doesn't have to cost a lot, just a bit of thought and preparation. On a bigger scale it is silly to have electric vehicles in Australia. When we visit family in NSW it is an 8000 km round trip - electric vehicles cannot go for up to 1400 km per day as my current vehicle does, so this would necessitate our flying. Big picture - why is the temperature on Mars also increasing??? Some countries cannot afford to make as many changes as others, but they should not be disadvantaged.
