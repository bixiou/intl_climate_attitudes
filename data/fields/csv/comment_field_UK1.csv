For example subsidies on home insulation have typically benefited installers rather than homeowners and subsidies on biofuel diverted land use from food crops and caused hunger in poorer counties.

Taxing high income earners doesn't work: they simply move themselves or their income elsewhere. We need to find ways of taxing large corporates effectively. We also need guarantees of long term stability in Government policies: constant policy changes make it impossible for individuals or organisations to plan.

Wind turbines kill many, many birds. The fact that our sun is a major cause of global warming and has been throughout the millennia.
