There is enough schemes for the poor. You should be able to keep what you worked for. That's why it is wrong to tax earners differently. You work for R2000 pm and pay basically no tax. It also did not cost you anything to earn that R2000. On the other hand - You inherited a million Rand, invested it and changed that into 2 million. Why must you give away half of that?  Because you risked it and made it more??? Even putting it in the bank to earn interest? NO NO NO.  What is yours is yours. What's good for the goose is good for the gander. I dont drink and I dont smoke, but I still feel it is wrong to charge those people more and more every tax year. Maybe ALL tax can be dropped and VAT made 50%. Then you can work harder, earn more, and pay the same as others on what they buy. Just my opinion.  Remember, Im 64, retired and on SASSA only...
