The government has a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the United Kingdom by 50% on 1990 levels by 2025 and to net zero by 2050.";"My main consideration about climate change are that: progress is too slow; a lot of suggested 'solutions' seem to be based on technologies which do not exist or are at a very early stage and unproven; companies play up their 'green' credentials and how much they will be doing but this frequently appears to be at least as much marketing as action; and the public - myself included - is generally not fully informed about the issues, about urgency, about what responses are valuable and which are merely sticking plasters and wishful thinking or maybe even disingenuous; and the public - again, I do not excluse myself - tends not to take the urgency seriously and seems unwilling to make efforts and sacrifices which are required immediately. All of these factors are intertwined.\n \n The UK government, unfortunately, appears to put more emphasis on saying that they are doing the right thing than then driving forwards effective initiatives. They seems unwilling to lay it on the line that the public will have to make changes in lifestyle and readjustments to their expectations when it comes to non-essential behaviour and purchasing. Similarly it seems unwilling to stand up to the lobbyists for large companies and industrial groups - which may or may not be significant party donors - and to demand that they make radical changes to their operations, which may include stopping the never ending propaganda to consume and to conform to wasteful behaviour.\n \n So, to turn the previous paragraph into action, I would suggest that the UK government needs to start by being honest, both with the public and with business. It should try to avoid doing this in a confrontational fashion and it should not be scare-mongering - at least not more than is required to get through people's complacency.\n \n This is calling for very subtle and assured communications which governments do not always have (I am not singling out the current UK government because these seem to have been recurrent failings during my lifetime though the UK governement's HIV advertising in the 1980s, while criticised at the time, has come to be held in higher regard as effectively expressing the virus's danger.)\n \n This communication should also move from the dangers to expressing the positives; eg cutting down on unncecessary car travel might seem like a major sacrifice to many people but by emphasising that going to the countryside from fresh air is paradoxical if the car is polluting and emphasise how much nicer urban and rural environments are with fewer vehicles on the road.\n \n This public groundwork would be matched by working with companies using a carrot and stick approach; rewards for companies which take effective actions that go beyond marketing messages and 'greenwash' but penalties for those that do not. And, as with the public, the government should have done the research and be able to promote the positives to industry in these discussions; eg point out that the government is going to be wholeheartedly promoting green changes to the public and that this gives business opportunities to join the trend - or to be left behind and lose customers.\n \n After that I'll leave it to the scientists; as if it wasn't obvious from the above, I'm an arts graduate - which means at best I understand a a bit about human nature and communications but when it comes to hard facts I bow to those who have done the heavy lifting! :)";"Increase use of nuclear power, stop misleading claims by companies and their green credentials.

I appreciate that there are lots of issues facing the uk, but none of them matter if we don't have an earth to live on. There needs to be an overhaul of infrastructure to make it easier for joe public to AFFORD to be more green. An an example, when we bought our house, money was tight, I'd have LOVED to get air source heat pumps, but at £5-8k including installation, we just couldn't afford to and had to go down the route of getting a gas boiler (at less than a quarter of the cost) I appreciate the government are doing these £5k grants from next year, but it won't go far enough and the cost still exceeds the costs of gas boilers. The same with e-vehicles. I'm currently looking at purchasing a new car and can afford around £9k. It needs to be a family vehicle as we have a baby on the way. The only hybrids I can afford are small hatchbacks and from around 2012, and technology has on a lot since then so hybrids from that time are not too far in sustainability to modern day petrols.

Prioritise subsidies for electric cars and public transport. I would love to own an electric car and power my home in a green way, but as I rent I feel I’m limited in what I can do.
