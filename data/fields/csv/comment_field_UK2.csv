Similarly, I have been vegetarian for over quarter of a century so questions about beef consumption are kind of alien to me; and not asking about my food habits might not give a full context for my answers.\n \n This brings me to another issue: some of the questions seem to be based in rather too neat hypotheticals and general answers: eg questions about insulation do not take into account the varied nature of building standards in the UK. I found the questions about carbon tax to be problematic; in an ideal world with trustworthy government, this tax would be ring fenced but history tends to indicate that taxes tend to go into a general pot which governments draw on for all needs - especially when election time is close and they want to bribe the electorate.\n \n The questions about beef farming and consumption gave me pause for thought. As a vegetrian I would be happy to see people finding alternatives to meat eating. But, as I understand it, a move from a carnivore diet is far from simple because stocks of animals bred for slaughter cannot be reduced in a short amount of time; and with emissions from farming being a major contribution to greenhouse gases, this is a thorny topic because it requires fast action but mass slaughter of livestock is probably not an option, either in terms of public acceptance and also pollution from disposal of the carcases. Plus a plant based diet is not without very serious ecological costs, as has been highlighted with the growth of almond 'milk' and soya use in meat substitutes.\n \n Finally, there were one or two instances when dollar signs had not been changed to GBP and a graphic representing government in the video that looked suspiciously like the White House. Cultural imperialism! :)\n \n Seriously, I hope that this survey produces valuable results. It was an interesting one.

The very last sentence of the 5 minute video gave the game away:  it as good as stated as fact that climate change can be halted if all proposed measures - as mentioned in the video - are enacted.  I don't know when I've heard anything more preposterous - apart from all the climate change guff with which we are assailed daily.\n IF - I repeat IF (as most of the induced panic is based on the weather records of a piddling 150 years)- climate change is under way then it's under way and nothing mankind does will stop it.  To suppose otherwise is to imagine that we can control the actions of the Sun, of the ocean currents, of jet streams, of plate tectonics and volcanic activity.  \n Whenever I hear talk of 'the wettest summer ever recorded', the 'hottest summer ever recorded', 'the worst storms since records began' I literally despair.  Anyone would think the earth was only 200 years old listening to this sort of thing.  Climate change has been a constant ever since the world had an atmosphere and every variation from one extreme to the other - from 'snowball earth' to 'hothouse planet' - has been, and will continue to be, manifested as long as the earth exists.  Our presence on this planet - which constitutes less than the blink of an eye in the billions of years of earth's existence - is utterly irrelevant to these fundamental planetary processes.  To suppose that we can control them is wholly hubristic.  What we CAN do - and HAVE done before now, during recent Ice Ages, for example - is ADAPT to climate change.  As I've already said, all talk of arresting it, even altering it, is leading us into adopting policies that will destroy economies and beggar the livelihoods of everyone on earth.  It's all going to end in tears.  Certainly, if the current government achieves its aim of Net Zero by 2050, all it will have done is reduce the world's carbon emissions by 1% and reduced our country to the status of a 14thC economy in the process.

The key to the whole argument is a single extraordinary couple of words: Environmental accounting. To achieve sustainable development we are going to have to make some fundamental changes to the way we measure wealth and growth: we need to incorporate the value of environmental assets into economic theory.\n \n GNP takes no account of the value of natural resources. Everything would be different if environmental impacts, i.e. sea level rise, were given a monetary value, and if the prices of goods and services reflected the cost to the environment of producing or delivering them. This would expose many technologies as very environmentally expensive. It would also help boost research and development: while environmental resources remain underpriced, there’s little incentive to design technologies that use them more efficiently.\n \n Therefore, it is possible that in 100 years time the average person will be \'poorer\' in strictly financial terms but at the same time richer because they will not be under the influence of consumerism and they may be healthier and happier ... just a thought!\n \n ";"There should be a survey like this so that people will know";"I dont now";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"No comments";"None";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"LONG SURVEY";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"none";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"N/A";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"Started to get very long and boring.";"No comments";"NA";"NA";"NA";"Great survey happy.to help";"Thank you for letting me take part";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"NA";"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SURVEY";"NA";"If eletric cars were cheaper i would buy one.";"NA";"I think climate change is important to condsider in every day life";"NA";"Garbage topic!
