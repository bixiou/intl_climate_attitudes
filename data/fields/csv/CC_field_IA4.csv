They have committed to stringent plans to lower contributions to environmental damage.In the last few years, climate change has become politicised — as a positive force encouraging hopefuls to debate how to address it, as well as a bitter excuse to mock opponents not sufficiently prioritising other ‘pressing’ issues such as job security or poverty.\n For governments that dismiss climate change — like the United States under Donald Trump — public movements have come up to challenge and hold them accountable.In India, however, the movement hasn’t gained as much momentum as in the West.It seems India is doing a great job on the surface. So what’s the need for a mass movement Of all G20 (group of 20) nations, India is hailed as the one that has come close to meeting its 2015 Paris Agreement goals.It is spending nearly Rs 2,000 crore public funds on its ambitious solar energy plan. With this, the government seems to be keeping up with its pledge of generating 40 per cent of power from renewable sources.A study by Steve Crabtree, research analyst at consultancy group Gallup, found that 77 per cent Indians were satisfied with the current government’s efforts to combat climate change. In fact, shortly after Narendra Modi assumed office as Prime Minister in 2014, he renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests as the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.While it is true that India’s net carbon emissions are significantly lower given the population size, and Modi’s plans to invest in renewable energy seem commendable, the reality is far from ideal.More than half our GDP is singularly dependant on coal. Pollution from the combustion of fossil fuels —  of which coal is the most polluting — is responsible for over nine million deaths globally. India represents about 50 per cent of that number.\n Despite this, the central government continues to heavily subsidise the coal mining industry, pumping in nearly Rs 60,000 crore annually. In 2015 the government also introduced the Coal Mines Special Provision Act, which opened the sector to commercial mining by private companies.One of the main goals of the Modi government is to bring India to a $5 trillion economy — brought down from the initial $20 trillion ambition — by 2024. This will inevitably come at the cost of the same government’s ostentatious climate change promises.\n \n ";"Climate changes are not predicted properly by the weather forcasters.Disasters due to Sudden climate change can be prevented to some extent by proper prediction by weather forcasters.";"\n ";"In rainy season flood may occur in my country";"During winters should provide warm clothes to those who are in need.\n Should launch a water campaign during rainy seasons to harvest the rain water for summers.\n ";"Ignorance of people regarding the issues is one of the main problems.\n \n Implementing strict rules regarding our environment and explaining how important our Environment is.

The Himalayan eco-system possesses nearly 51 million people who practice hill agriculture. Most of the India's river systems in the North originate from glaciers in the Himalayan region. The Himalayas are therefore major source of fresh water for the perennial rivers such as the Indus, the Ganga, and the Brahmaputra. Glacial melt may impact their long-term lean-season flows, with adverse impacts on the economy in terms of water availability and hydropower generation. For centuries, Himalayan ecosystem has remained delicately balanced, and has been responsible for the tremendous biodiversity of the region. The ecosystem has become increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of changes due to natural causes, anthropogenic emission related causes and also due to developmental paradigms of the modern society.  The National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem has been launched with the goal of addressing all such issues holistically and in coordinated manner by involving all possible stakeholders.  \n ";"Vibhinn vegyaniko se jalvayu parivertan ke sambadh me baat karni chahiye, aur jo bhi mission hai unko badava Dena chahiye, factry se polution Kam ho uska samadhan karna chahiye";"Without faster emission cuts.
