Provide incentives for production and sales of clean power production, electric vehicles, wind generator farms.";"I am a retired, widowed senior.  I am on a fixed income.  The cost of living rises significantly each year. Fixed expenses all rise. For example, this year my city has already planned on my property taxes rising 3% this year. Hydroelectricity, gas for home heating, my water bill, food, etc. will all rise by a certain percent each year.  Let’s say .5% each, although I think it will be a lot more than that, but for this discussion let’s say that adds another 2% - so now I will have a rise of 5% in expenses. I am sharing this to help explain where I am coming from.   \n I do believe that climate change is an important issue. My biggest worry is how this will impact my day to day expenses.   \n For example, we are already paying a tax at the gas pump which is hurting me.  I understand this is very likely going up again.   \n My question is where is the money from this tax going?  Does it go into the general government revenue?  Is it going to research to deal with climate change?  Who is making money and lining their pockets with this money?  \n More has to be done for development of safe electricity.   \n I feel nervous about nuclear energy and it’s safety. Where are all those spent rods going?  Into the ground?  What is it doing to our ground water? \n A nuclear disaster WILL happen. It is just a matter of when.  \n We need ways of storing energy produced by wind, solar and water.   \n At this point I would not purchase a electric vehicle.  I have read that the thing you plug in is not “universal” - each car manufacturer has a unique “plug”.  Also, electricity is very expensive and charging my vehicle would be prohibitive for me.  \n Various family members travel to visit family.  Where they travel to barely has enough gas stations to get from point A to point B.   \n When my children were younger we would travel from Ottawa to Hamilton/Burlington.  We would stop along the 401 ONCE for gas and a bathroom break lasting about 10-15 minutes and then we were back on the road.  Those rest stops were ALWAYS very busy. \n It takes too long to charge up a vehicle. AND You don’t get enough distance for longer trips.   \n Will there be enough charging outlets for everyone to charge up and be out in 10 minutes and get enough distance out of their charge. \n What about more remote roadways/highways?  Who is going to install charging stations around my province?  Who is going to pay for this?…the government?  How much is it going to cost the government (taxpayers) to install charging stations?   \n Will I be able to charge up my vehicle quickly at home?  In the middle of the winter will I have to go out somewhere to charge up? \n I should be able to charge up in a matter of minutes, at home and not every day. \n I should be able to charge up with a regular three prong outlet in my driveway.  Right now I understand that it is quite expensive to have an appropriate “special plug” installed at my house. \n Speaking of hydro…I don’t know who determines the “time of use” rates but is clearly someone who doesn’t live in Canada.  Now that I am entering my first winter as a retiree I am VERY worried about the cost I will incur being at home.  When I was working I would lower the temperature to 16 degrees Celsius during the day, I would postpone raising the temperature and making dinner until as close to 7 p.m. as possible so that I would be paying the “off peak” rates.   \n It is Thanksgiving weekend and I still haven’t turned my furnace on despite my house being 17 degrees.   \n I don’t know what I will do in the winter to stay warm.  I guess bundle up, wear many layers, cover myself with a blanket since daytime rates are “on peak” from 7:00-11:00 a.m. and 5:00-7:00 p.m. and “mid peak” hours are 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. \n Meanwhile, the president/CEO of Ottawa hydro is making an annual salary of OVER $400,000.00 plus additional compensation of OVER $40,000.00 \n Do these people not know that during the daytime I need to heat my house to be comfortable?   \n Are they not familiar with the temperatures in winter? \n And what about families? The “on peak” rates are the highest rates when people are coming home from work, the children are using electricity for doing homework and meals are being prepared. \n I am doing everything to keep my “on peak” useage to the bare minimum.  I don’t run my laundry or dishwasher until the weekend.   \n I am being penalized for “following the rules” and trying to be as careful with my impact on the environment. \n I feel that those of us who try to do things to conserve energy and do their part for the climate are being penalized financially at every turn. \n My city is talking about possible changes and penalties around garbage collection and recycling.  I have followed the rules to a “T” but now I will likely be paying more for garbage collection on my property tax bill and on top of this- at the curb.  I am being punished for being responsible.   \n When I do have to go out in my vehicle I make a point of doing a series of chores all in one trip.  I map out my route so that I get everything done without doubling back on myself to save gas and to accomplish everything on one trip.   \n I don’t use public transit.  I feel it is unsafe.  I feel that my personal safety is in jeopardy.  I would never use it after dark.  During Covid19 it is too crowded.  As a senior, the walk to to bus stop is icy and snow covered in the winter. I am too great a risk for a fall to walk to a bus stop.  There are huge snow banks to climb over to get on a bus. Again a hazard for me. \n Meanwhile the government is bringing more and more people into the country.  This means more of our resources are being used.   \n More and more homes are being built on arable land.   \n Look at southern Ontario.  It used to be full of farms, fruit farms, etc. They were located close to the markets they served but now there are just rows and rows of townhouses and we have to import more and more of our food and we have become dependent on others for our food! \n ";"Nothing";"Try and reduce greenhouse gas emissions but still support energy sector";"Reduce carbon emissions by promoting energy saving activities across the country.
