We would like to discuss with you in more detail the study you just participated in and to explain exactly what we were trying to study.

Before we tell you about all the goals of this study, however, we want to explain why it is necessary in some kinds of studies to not tell people everything about the purpose of the study before they begin.

As you may know, scientific methods sometimes require that participants in research studies are not given complete information about the research until after the study is completed. Although we cannot always tell you everything before you begin your participation, we do want to tell you everything when the study is completed.

We don’t always tell people everything at the beginning of a study because we do not want to influence your responses. If we tell people what the purpose of the study is and what we predict about how they will respond, then their responses would not be a good indication of how they would respond in everyday situations.

This study had two goals: understand what you know about climate change and assess what could influence your views on climate policies. For this purpose, we varied the financial incentives for answering the survey and varied the list of items in one question asking you to count how many items applied to you. This was randomized, meaning that you were randomly allocated to one of these branches, while other respondents went into other branches. We could not tell you this beforehand as this may have affected your responses and we wanted them to be as they would in a real world setting. Please note that the information was ENTIRELY accurate and there is nothing misleading in any of the questions.

If other people knew the true purpose of the study, it might affect how they behave/answer questions, so we are asking you not to share the information we just discussed.

I hope you enjoyed your experience and I hope you learned some things today. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at the email provided in the consent form.

Do you have any other questions or comments about anything you did today or anything we’ve talked about?
